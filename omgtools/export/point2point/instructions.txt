Build instructions
------------------

* Assign the upper variables in the Makefile
    * CASADIDIR: path of your casadi binary installation. If you built casadi
                 from sources, you can leave this blank.
    * CASADIOBJ: path of your generated casadi functions object files (grad_f.so,
                 jac_g.so, hess_lag.so and nlp.so)
    * SOURCEFILES: extra cpp files that you want to built with the toolbox. If
                   you decide to build the toolbox as library (.so), you can
                   leave this blank.
    * EXECUTABLE: name of resulting executable.

* Build the source files
    * Build to executable: make
    * Build to library (.so): make lib
    in the bin/ directory you can find your executable or library

* Link the library with your project (only if built to .so)
    * You built casadi from sources:
        Suppose you have set the following variables
            * MPINCL: path to directory containing MotionPlanning.hpp
            * MPLIB: path to directory containing libmp.so
        then you can build your application (suppose application.cpp) with our
        toolbox as follows (eg. with g++):
            g++ -I$(MPINCL) -std=c++11  -o application -L$(MPLIB) -Wl,-rpath=$(MPLIB) -lomg -lcasadi application.cpp
    * You istalled the casadi binary:
        You need to tell the compiler where he can find the header files
        and the libcasadi.so library. These are located respectively in the
        include/ and casadi/ subfolder of you casadi binary path.
        Suppose you have set the following variables:
            * CASADIINCL: path to casadi include/ subfolder
            * CASADILIB: path to casadi casadi/ subfolder
        then you can build your application (suppose application.cpp) with our
        toolbox as follows (eg. with g++):
            g++ -I$(CASADIINCL) -I$(MPINCL) -std=c++11  -o application -L$(CASADILIB) -L$(MPLIB) -Wl,-rpath=$(MPLIB) -lomg -lcasadi application.cpp
